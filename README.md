## About The Project
I love the whole Synthwave aesthetic! I like the music, artists like [Dreamkid](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0603X4AUnZec4wiHJNsynF), [Daniel Delux](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0OTY72l7CC7ynKzp6N2o5b) and [Code Elektro](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3FIZFOkx25ESPENGx6st5w). I love [Robb Owen's SynthWave '84 VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode). I made a [synthwave](https://github.com/grjsmith/Neon-Synthwave) [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) theme. It was about time I created a Rainmeter theme. Times have changed since I created the [Clean Text and Graphs theme](https://github.com/grjsmith/clean-text-and-graphs-for-rainmeter) that was designed to sit at the top of the screen. Now I wanted something that could site on the right or left side of the screen or, in my case, on the right side of my second monitor.

### Built With

* [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

* Download Rainmeter from [https://www.rainmeter.net/](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
* Download the skins from [my S3 bucket](https://entropybit.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Neon+Synthwave+Gauges_0.2.rmskin)

### Installation
* Install Rainmeter, [following the excellent documentation if you need it](https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual/installing-rainmeter/)
* Navigate to the place you saved ``Neon Synthwave Gauges_0.1.rmskin`` and doubleclick on it. That will open the Rainmeter skins window and all you to open the skins you want to use.

## Roadmap

* I'd like to see if I can find out how to add more useful information to some of the tooltips

See the [open issues](https://github.com/grjsmith/Neon-Synthwave-Gauges/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
